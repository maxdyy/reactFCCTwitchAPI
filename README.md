# reactFCCTwitchAPI

This is a project assignment for **FFC - Use the TwitchTV JSON API**

## About

[**Demo**](https://maxdyy.github.io/reactFCCTwitchAPI/)

This is a simple web app that searches for users on twitch and shows if their channel is online and what they are streaming.

## Tech

I've used React to build this app, since I'm learning it, I thought it would be a good idea to practice on this.

React setup is done with ``` npx create-react-app ``` - [link](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

For fetching data I've used ``` axios get request``` - [link](https://github.com/axios/axios)

Front-end components such as the search bar and the card are ```antd``` - [link](https://ant.design/)

The build is published on GitHub pages with ```gh-pages``` [link](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages)
